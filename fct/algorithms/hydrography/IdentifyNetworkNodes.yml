parameters:
    INPUT:
      type: LineString(ZM)
      description: |
        Stream network, oriented from upstream to downstream.
        MutliLineStrings are not supported.
    QUANTIZATION:
      type: Number
      description: |
        Tolerance for node pairing (in number of decimal).
        Nodes are considered identical if their coordinates are within this tolerance.
        Default is 1e8.
    OUTPUT:
      type: LineString(ZM)
      description: |
        LineString with nodes identified.
      fields:
        - NODEA: unique identifier of the FROM node
        - NODEB: unique identifier of the TO node
    NODES:
      type: Point(ZM)
      description: |
        Point features representing the nodes of the network.
      fields:
        - GID: node unique identifier
