displayName: Select Connected Reaches
group: hydrography
summary: Select reaches connected to the selected one in the input layer.
description: |
  The input hydrographic network needs to be well oriented. You can use the [Fix Link Orientation](/fct-qgis/algorithms/hydrography/FixLinkOrientation/) to check that.
  
  This tool is useful to extract a subset of a hydrographic network.

  Examples: 
  
    - Select a downstream reach in the network, then execute *Select Connected Reaches* with upstream `DIRECTION` parameter. All the upstream reaches will be selected.
    - Select an upstream reach in the network, then execute *Select Connected Reaches* with downstream `DIRECTION` parameter. All the downstream axis will be selected.
