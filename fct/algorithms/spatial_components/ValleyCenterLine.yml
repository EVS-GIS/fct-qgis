displayName: Valley Centerline
group: spatialcomponents
summary: |
  Center-line (ie. medial axis) of the input polygons based on an auxiliary
  stream network.
description: |
  Compute the medial axis of one or multiple polygon(s). 
  Useful for computing centerlines of a valley bottom or any other 
  polygon for which you have a corresponding stream network.

  If a stream network is not available for your polygon (ex. historical channel), it is possible to 
  use instead a created LineString which cut the polygon boundaries upstream and downstream.

  The polygons and the stream network features are linked using a common attribute (like a FID). 

  Algorithm:
  
      Intersect the input polygon boundaries with the stream network
      Keep the most distant resulting points (upstream and downstream points)
      Cut the input polygon boundaries with the upstream and downstream points (get two polygon sides)
      Compute Voronoi polygons with points on the sides and dissolve it on each side
      Cut the Voronoi lines with the input polygon
      Remove duplicate lines
      Smooth result
    
  Advices:

      You can apply a small buffer on your polygons to avoid network going out of the polygon too many times increasing drastically the computing time.
      You can also extend the network lines to be sure they cut the polygons upstream and downstream.
