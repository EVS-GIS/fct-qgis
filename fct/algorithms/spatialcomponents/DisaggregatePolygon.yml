  Prior to assess metrics to characterize a fluvial system, fluvial units 
  have to be disaggregated [@roux2014]. This step enables to discretize a continuum 
  with a constant length in order to provide a higher resolution for 
  characterizing fluvial units. The constant length must be set precisely 
  to ensure spatial trends or relationships between several variables to be 
  correctly detected either at a network scale or at a local scale. 

  The disaggregation process is based on delaunay triangulation around regularly spaced points along the centerline. 
  The width of the DGOs are calculated using the following algorithm: 

      place a point every STEP/10 along the polygon ring (so approximately 10 points are placed per DGO per side)

      for each point:
        find the nearest DGO center point
        calculate the distance between the two points
        multiply this distance by 2

      for each DGO:
        find all associated points along the polygon ring
        calculate the mean of the distances between the DGO center point and the associated points

  This width is only an approximation and meaningful if the polyline supplied is the centerline of the disaggregated polygon.
