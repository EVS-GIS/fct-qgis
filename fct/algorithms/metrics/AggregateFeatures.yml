displayName: Hubert-Kehagias Aggregation
group: metrics
summary: |
  Perform a basic Hubert test and aggregate homogeneous segments in an AGO field.

description: |
  Aggregate disaggregated objects with respect to a given metric, using the Hubert-Kehagias segmentation procedure.
  A ID_AGO field is created to identify the homogeneous segments. 
  The Hubert Test is an univariate statistical test based on the standard deviation, enabling to identify locations of breaks into a set of
  numerical data. The output set of data is modeled as succession of straight and
  constant lines (or “segments”). [@roux2014]
