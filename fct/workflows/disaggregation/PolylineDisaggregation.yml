displayName: Polyline disaggregation
group: disaggregation
summary: |
  Disaggregate input polyline on inflection points and calculate bendlength, 
  wavelength, sinuosity, amplitude, omega0 and omega1 of each disaggregated segment.
  Return also attributed inflexion points and inflection lines.

description: |
  In order to characterize fluvial corridors thanks to a set of metrics, 
  it is necessary to create entities which do not necessarily have a 
  physical reality. It is the case of the inflection line, used during 
  a set of planimetric metrics assessment such as the streamline sinuosity 
  or the half-amplitude of bends. The inflection line of a curve is 
  defined as the line passing through its inflection points.
