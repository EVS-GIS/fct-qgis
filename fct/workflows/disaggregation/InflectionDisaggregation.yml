displayName: Inflection Disaggregation
group: disaggregation
summary: |
  Disaggregate input polyline on inflection points and calculate bendlength, 
  wavelength, sinuosity, amplitude, omega0 and omega1 of each disaggregated segment.
  Return also attributed inflection points and inflection lines.

description: |
  In order to characterize fluvial corridors thanks to a set of metrics, 
  it is necessary to create entities which do not necessarily have a 
  physical reality [@roux2014]. It is the case of the inflection line, used during 
  a set of planimetric metrics assessment such as the streamline sinuosity 
  or the half-amplitude of bends. The inflection line of a curve is 
  defined as the line passing through its inflection points. 

  This workflow simplyfy and smooth the input network, then extract inflection points. 
  If you prefer to use the raw network without simplification, use the [Planform Metrics](/fct-qgis/algorithms/metrics/PlanformMetrics) 
  algorithm directly.

  Algorithm: 

      run multipart to singlepart on network
      simplify network (Douglas-Peucker method) by simplify offset parameter
      smooth network
      run Planform Metrics algorithm
