displayName: Oriented Centerline
group: spatialcomponents
summary: |
  Oriented center-line (ie. medial axis) of the input polygons based on an auxiliary
  stream network and a DEM.
description: |
  Compute the medial axis of a polygon and orient lines from upstream to downstream with provided DEM. 
  Useful for computing centerlines of a valley bottom or any other 
  polygon for which you have a corresponding stream network.

  If a stream network is not available for your polygon (ex. historical channel), it is possible to 
  use instead a created LineString which cut the polygon boundaries upstream and downstream.

  Algorithm:
  
      Intersect the input polygon boundaries with the stream network
      Keep the most distant resulting points (upstream and downstream points)
      Cut the input polygon boundaries with the upstream and downstream points (get two polygon sides)
      Compute Voronoi polygons with points on the sides and dissolve it on each side
      Cut the Voronoi lines with the input polygon
      Remove duplicate lines
      Drape lines on DEM
      Check/Fix links orientation

      Distance between points on the input polygon sides to compute the
      Voronoi polygons. The smaller the distance, the smoother the result will be.
