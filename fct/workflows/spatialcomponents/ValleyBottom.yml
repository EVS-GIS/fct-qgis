  Extract valley bottom from a DEM and a stream network.

description: |
  Within a watershed, extraction of a valley bottom related to a hydrographic network is a
  crucial step for the fluvial corridor characterization. Defined as the modern alluvial floodplain by [@alberSpatialDisaggregationAggregation2011], valley bottom is the deposition zone of alluvium since
  Holocene (Schumm, 1977) and includes both riverbed and floodplain. This valley bottom
  crucial fluvial unit with important water, material and biota transfers (Nanson and Croke,
  1992). Valley corridor width also controls fluvial dynamics and patterns so that extracting this
  layer is often a preliminary step in the biogeomorphic characterization of stream networks
  (Notebaert et Pi√©gay, 2013).

  3 methods to detrend DEM are proposed:
    
    - Topological is identical to [@roux2014] and [@alberSpatialDisaggregationAggregation2011].
    - Nearest is fast and helpful if your stream network does not match perfectly with your DEM.
    - Flow is slower, but precise. You may need to fill depressions of your DEM and resolve flat lands before trying to extract the valley bottom.
