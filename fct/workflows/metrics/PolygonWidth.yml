displayName: Disaggregated object width
group: metrics
summary: |
  Calculate a poylgon width (ex. active channel or valley bottom) with the VariableLengthTransects tool
  and resume the result by DGO. 

description: |
  Algorithm:

  - Create orthogonal transects from medial axis DGOs, spaced by the sampling interval and with a length defined by MAX_WIDTH parameter
  - Intersect transects by input polygon and measure length of each resulting intersection
  - Use the QGIS "Statistics by category" tool to calculate statistics by DGO

  To simply make orthogonal transects along a medial axis, use directly the [VariableLengthTransect](/fct-qgis/algorithms/vectors/VariableLengthTransect/) tool.
