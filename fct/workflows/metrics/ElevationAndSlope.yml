  Calculate elevation and slope of polylines based on a DEM.
  The polylines can be a sequenced network or a disaggregated network.

  Algorithm:

      drape the polylines on the DEM
      run the LineStringZSlope algorithm with draped polylines
      extract the elevation and slope values from the outputs
      join the outputs

  The output polylines contains new attributes `_mean`, `_median`, `_min`, `_max`, `_stddev`, `_first`, `_last` for elevation and slope.
