  Search for a point on the nearest line for each input node.
  
  If a line is found within the search distance,
  the line is splitted at the nearest point,
  and a new link is created between that node and the nearest point
  to connect lines together.

  The created link is oriented from the existing node
  to the nearest line, though it may not be meaningful.
  You should fix link orientation with `FixLinkOrientation`.
